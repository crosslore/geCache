    The geCache program is a Google Earth caching program that will run on 
Linux and Windows 10.  There are a few Google Earth caching programs for 
different versions of Windows but, as far as I know, none for Linux.  Until 
now.  The purpose of this program is to allow you to cache Google Earth data so 
that you can look at it in Google Earth while offline (for example, out in the 
middle of the boonies).

Although most of this program is licensed under GPLv3 there are a few files 
that are in the public domain that were written either by myself, by one or 
more of my co-workers when I worked for the Naval Oceanographic Office, or 
by someone at NOAA (in FORTRAN, in the dim distant past, and then converted to 
C).  Those files are:

        qPosfix.cpp
        qPosfix.hpp
        functions.c
        functions.h


Each of these files has a statement at the beginning of the file explaining 
that they are in the public domain.

All of the files in the icons directory are in the public domain with the 
exception of geCache.png and geCache.ico.  Those are (I guess) GPLv3.

When you acquired geCache you should have received or been allowed to 
download a copy of the source code for this program along with this README 
file, a COPYING file containing a text version of the GPLv3, and an INSTALL 
file.

The INSTALL file has instructions for building and installing geCache.
